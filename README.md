## Introduction

In this repository I made a simple Web Application using ReactJS to play the iconic Nokia3310 Snake Game.

You can visit the deployed app, at [Snake Game](https://slow-codex.github.io/snake-game/).

This repository contains the files related to the app. The `master` branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the `gh-pages` branch contains a *built* version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).


## Procedure

1. Download the given code as a zip or the full main branch.

2. Downloading and Instal any Code Editor for a simple edit of the database:

| **Code Editor** | **Link** 	|
|-	|-	|
| Visual Studio Code 	| [Download it from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)	|
| Sublime Text 3 	| [Download it from here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) |
| Atom 	| [Download it from here](https://atom.io/)	|


3. Run `npm start` in your respective terminal and voila the site will run on your `localhost:3000`

## Notes

* I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By default, apps created using `create-react-app` have a README.md file that looks like [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Indeed, the README.md file you're now reading originally looked like that. I have since changed it to look the way it looks today.
* Special thanks to GitHub, Inc., for providing us with the GitHub Pages hosting functionality at no extra charge.
* And now, time to turn the default `create-react-app` app into something unique.
